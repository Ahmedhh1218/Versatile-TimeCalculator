# Versatile-TimeCalculator

Versatile-TimeCalculator is a versatile and feature-rich project that combines the functionalities of a stopwatch, timer, and calculator into a single application. With seamless mode switching, users can easily transition between different modes as needed.

## Modes of Operation

### Stopwatch Mode
The Stopwatch Mode starts automatically upon launching the application. It provides three pushbuttons for controlling the stopwatch:
- Press '1' to pause the stopwatch
- Press '2' to resume the stopwatch
- Press '3' to reset the stopwatch

### Timer Mode
The Timer Mode allows users to set countdown timers. Simply input the desired time using the keypad and press '=' to start the countdown. The timer supports countdowns up to 59 minutes and 59 seconds. Upon completion, a red LED indicator will light up.

### Calculator Mode
The Calculator Mode enables users to perform basic mathematical operations. It prompts for the first number, then waits for the operator to be pressed (+, -, *, or /). Once the operator is entered, it prompts for the second number and displays the result. The result remains available for further calculations.
